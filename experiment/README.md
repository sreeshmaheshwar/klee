# Experimental Code

Lightweight benchmarking infrastructure for running [KLEE](https://klee-se.org/) and comparatively evaluating performances of different strategies. Centred around 

- twelve [Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) benchmark programs,
- deterministic runs,
- automated results and graph generation,
- progress and time logging over long experiments, and
- workload distribution.
